**Moral psychology** is the academic field at the intersection of mind, behavior, and ethics. Moral psychologists use scientific methods to study questions about morality, like how it evolved and develops across the lifespan, how people judge behaviors as right or wrong and people as good or evil, and how people act (or fail to act) in accordance with their moral values. In this course, we will explore questions like:

<div class="dashedBorders">

* How do we decide which behaviors should be forbidden for all people, and why do we sometimes disagree with others? <br> 
*	How do we form the impression that someone is a “good person” or “bad person”? <br>
* Why do people donate their money, time, blood, or organs to complete strangers? <br>
*	How do we justify to ourselves that we are good, even as we lie, cheat, steal, and hurt the people around us?

There are many ways to approach the study of moral psychology. This course draws most heavily from insights from *social psychology* research, and therefore most topics covered pertain to morality within social contexts, e.g., thinking about, reacting to, and judging the moral behavior and character of others. However, the course is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing from ideas and research from philosophy, behavioral economics, cognitive psychology, personality psychology, developmental psychology, neuroscience, biology, and other social science fields.
